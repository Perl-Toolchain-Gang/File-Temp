	* t/security.t: OS/2 can not do the security tests.

	* Temp.pm: Add Support for VMS and OS/2 

2000-05-15  Tim Jenness  <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

        * Release V0.08 to CPAN
	
	* t/mktemp.t: Skip the test for unlink0 if it fails since in most
	cases this indicates an NFS problem.

	* Temp.pm (_can_do_level): Add check to make sure an OS can handle 
	the required safe level
	(safe_level): Check the level can be supported before allowing it
	to change 
	(END): Change order of cleanup so that files are removed ahead of
	temp dirs (since files may be in the temp dirs) 

2000-05-08  Tim Jenness  <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* Temp.pm: Reorganize END block 

	* t/tempfile.t: Correct tests for new position of END{} block

	* t/security.t: Correct tests for new position of END{} block

	* t/posix.t: add # to print output

	* t/tempfile.t: Add # to print output

	* t/mktemp.t: Add # to print output

	* t/security.t: Add # to print output

	* Temp.pm: Calculate OPENFLAGS outside of subroutine. This
	improves speed of the commands by nearly a factor of 3.
	(_replace_XX): Inline the character replacement code rather than
	using _randchar subroutine. Improves performance by an additional 8%.

2000-04-27  Tim Jenness  <t.jenness@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* t/posix.t: Add explicit autoflush on filehandle

	* t/mktemp.t: Add explicit autoflush on filehandle

	* Temp.pm: (unlink0): Disallow HIGH and MEDIUM tests if running
	perl 5.005 or earlier.

	* t/security.t: Specify perl version to allow for tests

        * Add support for perl 5.005 (remove 'our' and auto-vivifying file 
	handles). VERSION NUMBER NOW 0.07

	* README: Update in preparation for V0.06 

	* Temp.pm (_deferred_unlink): Add new internal routine to centralise the
	configuring of END blocks. This also fixes a bug where only the
	first file was being unlinked in the END block (due to scoping).

	(_can_unlink_opened_file): Rename from _can_unlink. Will now
	return false if running on Windows.

	(_is_verysafe): If _PC_CHOWN_RESTRICTED is not available assume
	that "chown giveaway" is possible anyway.

	(unlink0): If can not unlink an open file, simply defer removal
	until later.

	(_gettemp): Add O_NOINHERIT and O_TEMPORARY flags to sysopen if
	they are available (Thanks to Tom Christiansen for this)

	* t/mktemp.t: Add test

	* t/posix.t: Add test

	* t/security.t: Add test

	* t/tempfile.t: Add test
